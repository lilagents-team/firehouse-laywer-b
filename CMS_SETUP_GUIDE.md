## Required Setup Steps

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup

1. **Create or use existing GitHub repository** for your website

   ```yaml
   backend:
     name: github
     repo: YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME  # Replace with your actual repo
     branch: main
   ```

### 2. Netlify Setup (Required for GitHub OAuth)

1. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify

     - Build command: `npm run build && cp -r public/admin dist/public/ && cp -r content dist/public/`

   - Netlify will automatically use these settings

   - Add yourself as a user

### 3. GitHub OAuth Setup (for Netlify hosting)

✅ **Since you're using Netlify**: You can use Netlify's built-in authentication!

   - Click "New OAuth App"
   - Settings:
     - Application name: "Firehouse Lawyer Sveltia CMS"
     - Homepage URL: `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app`
     - Authorization callback URL: `https://api.netlify.com/auth/done`

2. **Configure in Netlify**:
