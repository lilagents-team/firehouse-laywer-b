The 207 (k) exemption under FLSA, which exempts employees engaged in fire protection activities from the overtime laws, is controversial, and we discuss a huge 207 (k) case here; we then note that the US Supreme Court declined to hear another 207 (k) case where some firefighter/paramedics were deemed qualified for the 207(k)exemption even though they spent more than 20% of their time on unrelated activities that were not strictly firefighting; and a US Supreme Court case voiding an ADEA release; also, we address another case involving same-sex harassment; the concept of "medical necessity‚Äù under the FMLA; the disability leave supplement and promotional examinations; and to conclude, we consider an issue with mergers.
