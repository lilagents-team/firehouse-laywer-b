topic: The Interlocal Cooperation Act: RCW 39.34
subtopic: Issues with Separating Accounts under RCW 43.09.210
---

Today we discuss issues that arise between agencies that enter into an interlocal agreement under RCW 39.34 and how that may create a problem with "separating accounts" in the eyes of the State Auditor; we also address the doctrine of "bystander negligence", which essentially permits a bystander
who witnesses a traumatic event to have a cause of action against a negligent party who causes that
event.
