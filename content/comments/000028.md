We now discuss another jurisdiction’s consideration of the privacy rights of public employees in their personnel files; the duty to accommodate disabled firefighters under the ADA; the illegality of partial pay docking under FLSA; and then we consider some EEOC guidelines on offering disabled employees “equivalent positions” upon their return to work, and situations within which a leave request is covered by both the FMLA and the ADA.
