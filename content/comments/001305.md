Today we discuss what constitutes “adverse action” under Title VII, in the context of retaliation claims; a new law addressing the response standards for “substantially career” fire departments; RCW 70.160, which relates to smoking indoors, and policies of fire departments that may be required to comply with that law; and general issues with releasing medical records under HIPAA.
