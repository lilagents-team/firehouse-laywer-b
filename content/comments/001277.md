Today we outline the benefits and procedures of merger of fire districts under RCW 52.06 and annexation of cities or towns to adjacent fire districts pursuant to RCW 52.04, as well as through cities annexing unincorporated land into the city by annexations, along with a consideration of consolidation versus merger; we also consider a recent case finding that volunteers can sue their own agencies for damages, for negligently caused injuries.
