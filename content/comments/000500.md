As far as issues with volunteers under FLSA, this may be the most important issue to date, in which we discuss various issues, including, but not limited to, the definitions of “employee” and “nominal fees”, and the importance of those words in calculating whether an individual is a volunteer; liquidated damages; Department of Labor Opinions; and recent reform activity; and then, aside from FLSA we talk about the importance of property tax resolutions.
