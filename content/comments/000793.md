topic: Nepotism in Hiring
---

Today we address free speech considerations in the context of discipline; amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; the test to discern whether nepotism in hiring is legal; legislative amendments to the death benefits laws; LEOFF II employees being able to sue employers; employees not having a cause of action for “wrongful transfer in violation of public policy”; and to sum it up, we discuss physical fitness standards for firefighters.
