Today we address a myriad of issues with the Public Records Act, including giving the “fullest assistance” possible to records requestors, requiring that requests be made in writing, penalties, and records indexing; we also consider whether a discussion between two members of a governing body, when this does not constitute a majority of that body, is a “meeting” under the OPMA; there is also some legislation of interest addressing the finding in the Hangartner case that an agency cannot reject records requests on the grounds that a request is overbroad; we then briefly discuss the requirement that your agency hire a claims agent under RCW 4.96 to process claims.
