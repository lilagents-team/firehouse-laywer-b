The laws for how to dispose of real and personal property arise often in the fire service, and today we discuss some of the frequently asked questions relevant to this subject (as a side note, the surplus of personal property is also addressed in the October 2015 issue, which is contained under the “Surplus of Real Property: RCW 39.33.020” topic); we then turn to differentiating between independent contractors and employees, an important factor in determining potential liabilities and tax implications; and to conclude, we answer a tricky question about the “two-in two-out” rule.
