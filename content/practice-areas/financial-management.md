  Property taxes and other financial issues can be baffling to elected officials and fire chiefs, but after more than thirty years in "this business" of local government, Mr. Quinn has considerable expertise with regard to property taxes, fire benefit charges, interlocal agreements, and just contracts in general.

  Whether it is public works or purchasing apparatus, we are familiar with all of the laws, exceptions and rules regarding procurement. We have also led our clients through passage of excess property tax levies, and have considerable knowledge about fire benefit charges, which many fire districts in our area have adopted as an alternative revenue source.

  Financial management also includes understanding the complexities of municipal finance, debt financing, and compliance with state and federal regulations affecting fire district revenues and expenditures.
