  The Washington Public Records Act (PRA) is another "sunshine law" mandating government transparency. Much like the OPMA, this law is construed broadly and its exemptions are construed narrowly. This growing area of law requires that your staff be well trained on the intricacies of the PRA, but when counsel is needed, we are there for you quickly and with detailed advice.

  We deal with PRA issues in this office, practically on a daily basis, so we know when to claim an exemption and when not to claim an exemption. The Open Public Meetings Act (OPMA) requires that all meetings of a governing body of an agency be open to the public, with limited exceptions. For years, Mr. Quinn has navigated these exceptions, and understands how your agency may fully comply with the OPMA.

  He has more than thirty years' experience with such issues and deals with them every week in his practice. Now he often teaches classes on this law to fire commissioners, fire chiefs and their employees and/or volunteers throughout the state.
