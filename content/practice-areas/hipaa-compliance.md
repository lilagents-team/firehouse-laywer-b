  Washington and federal law are both very protective of the medical information of individual persons. Quite often, Mr. Quinn addresses the intricacies of these laws, to avoid the consequences of disclosing protected health information without proper authority. He is very conversant with these laws; sometimes we receive requests for advice on medical records issues many times in one week!

  He has developed numerous forms and policies to deal with HIPAA and the state's Health Care Information Act. These laws can be tricky, and we often get calls about release of information forms, what information can be disclosed and to whom, what needs to be redacted, and whether certain disclosures are mandatory or permissive.

  Fire departments and EMS services handle sensitive medical information daily, making compliance with HIPAA and state privacy laws absolutely critical to avoid costly violations and protect patient rights.
