  Mergers and Consolidations require a skilled attorney who understands not only their legal implications, but their political implications as well. Although Mergers and Consolidations has been a hot topic at many conferences in recent years, Mr. Quinn has actually been very active in consolidation and merger work since 1990.

  He was personally very involved and remains involved in the following agencies formed as a result of such alliances: Central Pierce Fire & Rescue, East Pierce Fire & Rescue, West Pierce Fire & Rescue, Valley Regional Fire Authority, Riverside Fire Authority (Centralia area), West Thurston Regional Fire Authority, South King Fire & Rescue, and the list goes on and on.

  He has also consulted with or advised planning groups, cities or towns and fire districts on such matters without being their attorney, such as Friday Harbor and San Juan Fire District No. 3, Bremerton and two Kitsap County fire districts, and many others. He has vigorously sought, throughout his entire career, to facilitate meaningful and lasting relationships between municipal entities.
