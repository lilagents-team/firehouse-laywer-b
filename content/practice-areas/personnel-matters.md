  We work in a fire station, and keep our doors open. Labor questions arise all the time, and fall under various different laws: Worker's compensation, disability leave, employment discrimination (ADA/WLAD), workplace safety (WISHA/OSHA), harassment, policies and procedures, collective bargaining, employment contracts, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the Family Medical Leave Act. The list goes on.

  Mr. Quinn's forty or more fire service clients probably employ approximately 2,000 people. We are also available to assist in labor negotiations at the bargaining table or behind the scenes, and have done so on various occasions. If there is a contract grievance filed, and arbitration is needed, we are willing to represent the employer throughout the arbitration proceedings.

  If negotiations reach impasse and no labor contract can be reached through bargaining, remember that firefighter and police bargaining units are entitled to go to "interest arbitration" in which a three-member panel will determine the terms of your contract.
