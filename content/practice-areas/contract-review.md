  More often than not, legal issues are resolved by recognizing the needs of those who have contrary interests to a client. Mr. Quinn has crafted and reviewed various mutual aid agreements and fire protection contracts, which were favorable to all parties involved, but most importantly, to his clients and the public they serve.

  Our contract review services include apparatus purchase agreements, construction contracts, professional services agreements, interlocal agreements, and mutual aid compacts. We ensure all contracts protect your interests while maintaining positive relationships with other agencies and vendors.

  Whether you're entering into a new agreement or reviewing existing contracts for compliance issues, we provide thorough analysis and practical recommendations to minimize risk and maximize your agency's legal protection.
