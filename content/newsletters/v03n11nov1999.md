# FLSA Compensatory Time Rules and Christensen v. Harris County Impact

*Volume 3, Issue 11*

## Overview

The document discusses updates on compensatory time (comp time) rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), legal implications for public employders regarding primary duty designations, and compliance with the Family Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Fair Trade Commission (FTC) regulations. Key cases include Christensen v. Harris County and Mellas v. C, which explore issues related to comp time limits and background checks.

## Key Takeaways

### Important Findings

- The Ninth Circuit ruled that the High Court's decision in Christensen v. Harris County overturned the cap on comp time and does not require a minimum of 50% supervisory duty test. Even if a reasonable limit is prescribed, it may still be at employer discretion to use some limited control over when compensatory time is used.
- The FLSA's requirements for exempt work are clear but not automatic. Employers must evaluate their workforce's needs while complying with legal standards.
- The FCRA imposes strict regulations on background checks, requiring employers to obtain written consent from applicants and ensure compliance with consumer rights obligations.

### Recommendations for Agencies

- Public employders should carefully review FLSA requirements for exempt work and ensure they are not overreaching in their application of primary duty designations.
- Employers must comply with FCRA regulations, including proper background check procedures to avoid legal violations.
- Comp time limits should be reconsidered based on current legal interpretations and employer needs.
