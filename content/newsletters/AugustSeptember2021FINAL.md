*2021-09-05*

## Overview

The document discusses Governor Inslee's Proclamation 21-14, which mandates COVID-19 vaccination for health care workers and EMS personnel. Legal implications include First Amendment rights (Medical Exemption, Religious Excuse), non-delegation doctrine from a court case, and potential negligence claims for spreading COVID-19. The document also explores EMS provider liability and state laws on qualified immunity.

## Key Takeaways

### Important Findings

- Potential negligence claims are a significant area of legal liability for EMS providers who treat COVID-19 patients or allow unvaccinated staff to work.

### Recommendations for Agencies

- EMS departments should not allow unvaccinated health care personnel to treat patients unless absolutely necessary and under specific conditions.
- Proactive measures such as training and preventive protocols can help reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in EMS settings.
- Departments should consider legal implications, including First Amendment rights and potential negligence claims when making staffing decisions.
