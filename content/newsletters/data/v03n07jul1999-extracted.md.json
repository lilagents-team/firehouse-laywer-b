  "summary": "The document discusses a legal case involving firefighters who were alleged to be volunteers rather than city employees. The court ruled that volunteers performing emergency medical services for private rescue squads are not considered full-time city employees under the FLSA. The Supreme Court emphasized that volunteer work, even if performed for the city, does not meet the criteria for full-time employment required by the FLSA unless compensated or controlled by the employer.",
