## Overview

The newsletter discusses updates to HIPAA and the Washington State Health Care Information Act (WSHLA), including an amendment requiring authorization for health care information release with a 90-day rule, exceptions under state law for permissive releases, reasonable fee provisions under state law, and attorney subpoena requirements.

## Key Takeaways

### Important Findings
