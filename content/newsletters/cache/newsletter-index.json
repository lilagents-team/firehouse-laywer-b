My reasoning has always been that the proposed bills may never be adopted into law so it is better to wait until they are signed into law by the Governor At that point if they are significant statutes at all we will write about them to educate members of the fire service in Washington However more and more often my clients ask about proposed statutes and what our opinion might be about them Therefore we are re-examining that practice so that once a year we may include an article such as you are about to read 2020 Proposed Laws SB 6582 This one-section bill simply makes it clear that a board of fire commissioners may call for an election to increase to a five-member or a seven-member board thus making it easier for a district to enlarge its board The additional members assuming voter approval are added to the board using the existing process for filling vacancies See RCW 52 14 020 and RCW 42 12 070.",
