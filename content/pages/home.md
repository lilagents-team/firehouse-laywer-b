  Managing a government agency is no easy task. Every day you address many challenges, and we will help you solve them. We understand that the ultimate goal of the fire service is to ensure the safety and wellness of every citizen.

  But that does not come without a cost to management. You may face an employee who alleges discrimination; a citizen who makes numerous public records requests; or the passage of an excess levy, which requires not only political will, but financial and organizational expertise.
