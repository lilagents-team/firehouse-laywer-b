  Mergers and Consolidations require a skilled attorney who understands not only their legal implications, but their political implications as well. Although Mergers and Consolidations has been a hot topic at many conferences in recent years, Mr. Quinn has actually been very active in consolidation and merger work since 1990.

  He was personally very involved and remains involved in the following agencies formed as a result of such alliances: Central Pierce Fire & Rescue, East Pierce Fire & Rescue, West Pierce Fire & Rescue, Valley Regional Fire Authority, Riverside Fire Authority (Centralia area), West Thurston Regional Fire Authority, South King Fire & Rescue, and the list goes on and on.

  The Washington Public Records Act (PRA) is another "sunshine law" mandating government transparency. Much like the OPMA, this law is construed broadly and its exemptions are construed narrowly. This growing area of law requires that your staff be well trained on the intricacies of the PRA.

  We deal with PRA issues in this office, practically on a daily basis, so we know when to claim an exemption and when not to claim an exemption. We provide comprehensive training and ongoing support.

  Eric and Joe Quinn facilitate annual Board retreats to train commissioners and administration about governance issues and working as a team, as is absolutely crucial in the fire service and government in general.
