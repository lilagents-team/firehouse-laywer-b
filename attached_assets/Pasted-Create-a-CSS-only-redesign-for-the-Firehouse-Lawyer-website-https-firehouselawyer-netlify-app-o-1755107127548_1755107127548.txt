Create a CSS-only redesign for the Firehouse Lawyer website (https://firehouselawyer.netlify.app/) on Replit, focusing on an urban, gritty aesthetic while preserving the existing multi-page layout and all original content. The site should maintain its current structure (Home, Newsletter, Practice Areas, Attorneys, Contact Us) and copy as seen in the provided screenshot, with no changes to HTML or JavaScript. Revamp only the colors, fonts, and design elements to set it apart from standard law firm websites while ensuring a sharp, professional appearance. Use vanilla CSS in a single `styles.css` file, compatible with the existing HTML, and deployable on Netlify.

**Requirements:**

1. **Design Aesthetic**:
   - **Urban/Gritty Style**: Apply a color palette with dark grays (#2F2F2F, #3A3A3A, #4A4A4A) as the base, accented by muted red (#8B0000) and neon orange (#FF4500) for bold contrast. Use textured backgrounds (e.g., subtle concrete or cityscape overlays) and distressed borders where applicable.
   - **Professional Edge**: Ensure sharp typography and clean layouts with high contrast for readability. Add subtle micro-animations (e.g., hover effects) to enhance dynamism without altering structure.
   - **Fonts**: Use 'Bebas Neue' and 'Montserrat' from Google Fonts for a gritty yet modern feel. Include the necessary font link in the CSS via `@import`.

2. **Structure and Content**:
   - **Preserve Layout**: Retain the multi-page navigation and section layout (hero, services, announcements, newsletter, footer) exactly as in the screenshot, with no structural or copy changes.
   - **Visual Elements**: Update the hero section background to an urban-themed image (e.g., cityscape or industrial texture from Unsplash) without modifying the text or buttons. Apply consistent styling to cards, buttons, and forms.

3. **Technical Specifications**:
   - **CSS**: Use vanilla CSS with resets, Flexbox, and media queries for responsiveness. Target existing HTML classes (e.g., `nav`, `header`, `section`, `.service-card`) and adjust properties like background-color, color, font-family, and border. Include a `@media` query for mobile (max-width: 768px) to ensure compatibility.
   - **Performance**: Optimize the new background image (compress to <200KB) and ensure text contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
   - **Deployment**: Ensure the CSS is compatible with the existing Netlify deployment, requiring no HTML or JS changes.

4. **Specific Features**:
   - **Navigation**: Style the sticky nav with a dark background (#1A1A1A) and neon orange links (#FF4500) that shift to muted red (#B22222) on hover.
   - **Hero Section**: Apply an urban background image with a text shadow for legibility, keeping the existing tagline and buttons styled with muted red (#8B0000) and hover effect (#B22222).
   - **Cards (Services/Announcements)**: Use a darker gray background (#4A4A4A) with a muted red border (#8B0000) and shadow for depth.
   - **Newsletter Form**: Style the input and button with a dark gray background (#2F2F2F), muted red border (#8B0000), and button hover effect (#B22222).
   - **Footer**: Update to a near-black background (#0D0D0D) with neon orange links (#FF4500) shifting to muted red (#B22222) on hover.

5. **File Structure**:
   - `styles.css`: Single file containing all redesigned CSS, replacing the existing stylesheet.

6. **Deliverables**:
   - A `styles.css` file with the urban, gritty redesign applied to the existing site structure and content.
   - Ensure the design avoids generic law firm looks while maintaining professionalism and sharpness.

**Example References**:
- For urban/gritty inspiration, reference industrial design trends or sites like https://www.valentinoatlaw.com/ (bold but clean), adapted to a grittier palette.
- Use Unsplash for a high-resolution urban background (e.g., search “cityscape gritty”).

**Constraints**:
- No changes to HTML structure, copy, or JavaScript functionality.
- Keep the CSS under 5,000 characters for Replit compatibility.
- Avoid frameworks or external dependencies beyond Google Fonts.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Add `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bebas+Neue&family=Montserrat:wght@400;700&display=swap');` at the top of `styles.css`.
- Replace the hero background `url()` with a specific Unsplash image link.
- Test the CSS in Replit by linking it to the existing HTML and previewing the result.
