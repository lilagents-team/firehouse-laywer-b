### About our law firm

At Eric T. Quinn, P.S, we have a common goal: Representing the Fire Service.

Managing a government agency is no easy task. Every day you address many challenges, and we will help you solve them. We understand that the ultimate goal of the fire service is to ensure the safety and wellness of every citizen. But that does not come without a cost to management. You may face an employee who alleges discrimination; a citizen who makes numerous public records requests; or the passage of an excess levy, which requires not only political will, but financial and organizational knowledge. The list goes on. Without guidance in these circumstances, you may face financial difficulty. We can help you avoid that, through a rigorous practice of collaboration and communication, whether it be speaking with you directly or updating our monthly newsletter, The Firehouse Lawyer. We understand your issues.

He amassed numerous experiences in law school as a legal intern, ranging from criminal defense to civil litigation.
