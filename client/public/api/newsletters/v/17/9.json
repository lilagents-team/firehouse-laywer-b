The first case, 'The 'Estimated Estimate' Case,' addresses the time estimates required by the PRA for responding to public records requests, emphasizing that agencies must provide initial estimates and only commit to the first installment of records. The second case, Hoffman v. Kittitas County and the Kittitas County Sheriff, involved a penalty of $15,498 imposed for a 246-day delay in providing public records, with no actionable findings due to agency mistakes.",

Actually all the DOC did was state that it would deal with the request within 45 further business days. The court held that an estimate is required in the initial '5-day letter' acknowledging receipt of the PRA request and that if the request is a large one it will probably suffice if the estimate of time relates only to the first installment.",
