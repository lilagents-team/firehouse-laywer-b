  "date": "1998-10-01",
  "summary": "The newsletter discusses the legal classification of firehouse workers as employees or volunteers under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), focusing on whether they are considered public employees or independent contractors. The document also examines compensatory time policies for on-call workers, referencing several court cases and regulations such as RCW 553.101(101) and 84.55. Key findings include the lack of clear legal distinction between employees and volunteers in this context.",
