The court ruled that volunteers performing emergency medical services for private rescue squads are not considered full-time city employees under the FLSA. The Supreme Court emphasized that volunteer work, even if performed for the city, does not meet the criteria for full-time employment required by the FLSA unless compensated or controlled by the employer.",
