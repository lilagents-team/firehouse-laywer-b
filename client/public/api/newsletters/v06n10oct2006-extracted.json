  "date": "2006-10-17",
  "summary": "The newsletter discusses three key legal cases involving deferred compensation plans, labor bargaining practices, and union interference. The first case highlights the legal distinction between mandatory, permissive, and illegal bargaining subjects under state public employee relations laws. The second case examines a ULP claim against a union for coercive tactics during representation changes. The third case underscores the importance of maintaining exclusive bargaining rights and avoiding ULPs through coercive inducements.",
