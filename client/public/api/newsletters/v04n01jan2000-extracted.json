EMTs generally do not qualify as fire protection workers unless specifically trained in fire suppression. The amendment clarifies that EMTs must meet additional criteria to be exempt. Case 1: Quin v. City of tacoma ruled that paramedics are not integral to fire suppression duties. Case 2: West v. Quin extended the wrongful discharge doctrine under public policy. The Public Policy extended wrongful discharge case applies to all terminations at will.",
