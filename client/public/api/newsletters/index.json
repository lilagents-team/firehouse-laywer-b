It highlights the lack of legal requirement for fire districts to award Lowest Responsible Bidding contracts unless specified by statute. The analysis concludes that fire districts may exercise their broad powers to enter into and perform any necessary contracts, even if they are not required to award the LRB. Additional topics include business functions, employment law considerations, public records access, emergency services regulations, contract awards, budget practices, training compliance, and litigation strategies.",
